        "\n",
        "* [High-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language): Python is fairly abstracted from actual [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). You won't have to handle individual bytes for the most part, and Python makes it relatively difficult to access things like [memory allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management), as most of that is handled automatically. This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage, but for beginning programmers, it's mostly a relief not to have to think about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "* [General-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language): Python can be used to run fully-featured applications and websites, but it can also be used as a [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) for automating tasks. You can program games in Python (although it's not great for that) or build machine learning algorithms (it *is* well-suited for that).\n",

Python code is compiled as it is run, or \"just in time\", by something called an interpreter, allowing for newly-written code to be deployed much more quickly."
